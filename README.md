# Time Stop (Projectiles)

Overview:

A simple plugin that adds a mechanic for MythicMobs (`- timestop{duration=#}`) that freezes all projectiles (excluding mythicmobs projectiles, for now) temporarily. In the future, this will contain time stopping for other entities/players, but for now, it is only projectiles.
